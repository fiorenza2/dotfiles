# Dotfiles Repo

Before anything else, install:
* `fish`
* Oh My Fish!
* `bobthefish`


| dotfile  | symlink  |
|   ---    |    ---   |
| `tmux.config` | `/etc/tmux.config`  |
| `.gitconfig`  | `~/.gitconfig`  |
| `config.fish`  | `~/.config/fish/config.fish`   |


* `.tmux.config` should symlink in either `/etc/tmux.config` or `~/.tmux.config` (latter for per-user level)

Here's some dotfiles. I'll still need to:
* Auto Install
* Find more dotfiles
